## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time exceeds 10 seconds for 2 minutes
- Health check failures for 3 consecutive checks

### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment
   vercel rollback [previous-deployment-url]
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   # Use Supabase dashboard for point-in-time recovery
   ```

3. **Communication**
   - Notify users via status page
   - Update internal teams
   - Document incident details

### Rollback Decision Matrix
| Issue Severity | Response Time | Rollback Decision |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Immediate | Automatic rollback |
| High | 15 minutes | Manual assessment |
| Medium | 1 hour | Monitor and fix |
| Low | Next release | Schedule fix |

  - Status checks passing
  - Up-to-date branches
  - Administrator enforcement

### Git Flow
```
main (production)
  ‚Üë
release/v1.0.0 (release preparation)
  ‚Üë
develop (integration)
  ‚Üë
feature/new-feature (development)
```

### Tagging Strategy
```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.0.0

# Tag format: v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}[-{PRERELEASE}]
```
